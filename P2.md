#### Discussion of findings

  - When creating a tournament, the cpu spends most of its resources saving the created tournament in the database (using the persist operation).
  - When getting the list of open tournaments, most of the resources are spent in the generation of tournamentDto's (mainly on date-time formatting operations) and secondarily in the sorting of the resulting list.
  - When enrolling the student, most of the resources are spent getting the user and tournament by id and formatting the date to a string on the Dto.

  - **Improvement :** in createTournament service restructured some attributes' validation, now validation is done at the moment od insertion instead of before the tournament object creation, preventing unnecessary findbyid calls ([solved](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_14-project/commit/abfd024e579467d4f65018225273b4edeb085da6))
  -  **Improvement :** found unnecessary set contains call for checking if student was already enrolled in the tournament, that check could be done by checking the return value of the set add call ([solved](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_14-project/pull/131/commits/5c1114f474bde746906588db19d0383b2fb30ad7))
