### End-to-end tests

To run these tests firstly you need to copy the file `cypress.env.json.example` and rename it to `cypress.env.json` and then you need to change the values inside this file to the ones of your database. 

`Note: User needs to have a password in the database in order to work properly`

#### Rationale
Both the *List Submitted* and *View Details* tests, from the student and the teacher, verify that the UI works accordingly: lists submitted questions (with permission to view them), and view more details (such as options).
The *Submit New* and *Update Topics* tests verify that the student can navigate the UI to submit valid student questions, checking for a duplicate title, and to add and remove topics to the submitted question.
The "Review* tests verify that the teacher can accept and reject listed student questions, given that he provides an explanation in case of the latter.

#### Rationale
The defined end-to-end tests show the dependency from the new views, where a student needs to create a request about a certain quiz question and the necessity of the teacher answer about this request so it appears in the student discussiow view. Since this is the common case of this new views group, we decided to create tests about this same aspect.

 - Tournament enroll: Confirms the students can successfully enroll and are not given permition to reenroll again on the same tournament or to enroll in the ones already started.
