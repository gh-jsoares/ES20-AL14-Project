`Note: User needs to have a password in the database in order to work properly`

#### Rationale
Both the *List Submitted* and *View Details* tests, from the student and the teacher, verify that the UI works accordingly: lists submitted questions (with permission to view them), and view more details (such as options).
The *Submit New* and *Update Topics* tests verify that the student can navigate the UI to submit valid student questions, checking for a duplicate title, and to add and remove topics to the submitted question.
The "Review* tests verify that the teacher can accept and reject listed student questions, given that he provides an explanation in case of the latter.
